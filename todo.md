TODO
---
- try graphql querying instead
- further cut down on reducer/action boilerplate
- oauth/token authentication
- application flow:
  - main:
    - loadCachedState
    - prompt for user auth, (username|token|oauth|anonymous)
      - offer don't ask me again option
      - if not anynymous, query for own gists
    - render rest of application
- regex application
- structure into background, popup, and conent
- perhaps use chrome storage sync

Backburner
---
- styling
- make extension agnostic for ff/opera, safari seems to require a payment for developers
